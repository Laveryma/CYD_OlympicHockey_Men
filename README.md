# CYD Olympic Hockey Scoreboard (Canada Men)

ESP32-2432S028 (CYD) scoreboard for **Milano Cortina 2026 men's hockey**.

## What it does

- Uses ESPN Olympic men's hockey JSON feed
- Focuses on `CAN` (Team Canada men)
- Auto-selects event priority:
  - in-progress Canada game
  - else next scheduled Canada game (countdown)
  - else most recent completed Canada game
- Screens:
  - `NEXT_GAME` (merged no-game + pre-game)
  - `LIVE`
  - `INTERMISSION`
  - `FINAL`
  - `GOAL` (when detectable from summary plays)
  - `LAST_GAME`
  - `STANDINGS` (group tables)
- Builds group standings from completed Preliminary Round games
- Loads country flags from SPIFFS (`/flags/...`), with runtime URL cache fallback
- Optional anthem playback at puck drop transition (`pre -> in`)
